    description: "The BMW Z3 was the company's first mass-produced roadster, initially gaining fame through its appearance in the James Bond film 'GoldenEye' before its market launch. Built at BMW's Spartanburg plant in South Carolina, it was primarily designed for the American market. The roadster (E36/7) initially launched with a 1.8L four-cylinder engine, with options later expanding to include various six-cylinder units up to the 3.2L in the M Roadster. In 1998, the lineup expanded to include the Z3 Coupe (E36/8), featuring distinctive 'shooting brake' styling often referred to as the 'clown shoe' due to its unique profile. The high-performance M Coupe variant featured the same 3.2L engine as the M Roadster, producing 321 HP in its later iteration. The Z3 combined classic roadster proportions including a long hood and short deck with distinctive BMW design elements like the kidney grille and quad headlights. The interior was relatively spartan but driver-focused, with later models receiving improved materials and equipment. The Z3 established BMW in the premium compact sports car segment, competing with vehicles like the Porsche Boxster and Mercedes-Benz SLK, before being replaced by the Z4 in 2002."
